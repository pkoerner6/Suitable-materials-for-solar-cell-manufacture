# Suitable materials for solar cell manufacture

This project is centered around identifying promising materials for organic solar cells, with a specific focus on predicting the HOMO-LUMO gap. The HOMO-LUMO gap serves as a crucial indicator of molecular efficiency in utilizing solar energyâ€”the larger the gap, the more efficient the molecule is for solar cells. Unlike traditional density functional theory, this project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the HOMO-LUMO gap from molecular descriptions.

The primary goal is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the HOMO-LUMO gap based on molecular features. This approach offers a more efficient alternative to conventional density functional theory methods.

## Data 
- Small Dataset: Consists of 100 molecules with associated HOMO-LUMO gaps.
- Large Dataset: Comprises 50,000 molecules with labeled LUMO energy levels.

## Transfer Learning
The project adopts a transfer learning approach, utilizing the large dataset with LUMO energy levels as a valuable resource. Although the labels are not the direct prediction target, there's a presumed correlation between features predictive of LUMO energy and the HOMO-LUMO gap. Features learned from the LUMO energy task are applied to enhance predictions for the HOMO-LUMO gap.
